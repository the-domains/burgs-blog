description: "Ever wish you could rest in a hammock while rowing around in a lake? Yeah, we haven't either. That doesn't make this Hammocraft any less cool, however. As the name would suggest, this structure is designed to hold up to five hammocks (not included) on a floatation device of your choosing so you can out-chill even the chillest bros."
