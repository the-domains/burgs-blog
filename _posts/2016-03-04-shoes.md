description: "The Air Jordan 17 retro begins in earnest this year, following the occasional one-off launch as part of a Countdown Pack. Yes, this time it's en masse, and it's starting with arguably the model's best colorway. The Air Jordan 17 Copper returns beautifully faithful to the original, as black croc-embossed leather around the heel contrasts a white leather upper."
