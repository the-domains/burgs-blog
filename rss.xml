            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shoes... Definitely need to get myself a pair of these</h1><p>You already know that the Air Jordan 4 Premium is set to drop in a blacked-out edition replete with croc-style scales and faux pony hair this month. But that may not even be the most eye-popping colorway of the upgraded model. That title would belong to the "Snakeskin" edition, rumored for a summer launch.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e30e9bc70f03d7942902ab9028241de8ed7de61b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Dammit...</h1><p>Physical exercise is good for your brain. And I mean really good for it. The brain burns a ton of energy during exercise, much more, even, than if you were thinking really hard about something really complicated. New research has discovered just what the brain does with all that extra energy.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d7e745156681fb88cdf63e61f8a59db122930b44.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Probably the funniest of all time</h1><p>During this year's NBA All-Star Weekend in Toronto, STASHED teamed up with HTC for their first-ever mini-documentary - the subject matter, the ever-popular "crying Jordan" meme. STASHED rounded up some of the league's most notable ballers to get their thoughts on the hilarious image.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3e708d27854d9c6bade57398c077108e58ba231c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Can't wait!</h1><p>Like anyone who's been paying attention, AT&T knows that the future of TV lies beyond the cable box and satellite dish. To make sure it keeps up, the company said today that it will begin letting you buy and watch cable TV on whatever screen you want with nothing more than an Internet connection.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d94279edaeffc8cde8d0b741902697ca03f0feed.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If you're like me you're already sick of the election... Check these chrome extensions out</h1><p>This past weekend, the merrymakers at Last Week Tonight introduced a novel Chrome extension that changes every mention of "Donald Trump" to "Donald Drumpf," his original ancestral surname. It's fun! You should install it, along with these other politically minded Internet add-ons that will help you make it to November with your sanity intact.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0fadecb0159931a72d348555e0c245b9b3633393.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Netflix trying to keep me inside as better weather hits</h1><p>March is going to be a bittersweet month for Netflix subscribers everywhere. We're losing Jumanji, Gone in 60 Seconds, Hart's War, Men in Black II, the TEDTalks series, and Johnny Dangerously, and we'll miss them all dearly. But where there's loss, there's growth. With death, there's life.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b730579dddaaf0a96b8dc130fd1dfa7925ac4839.jpg"></article>]]></description>
